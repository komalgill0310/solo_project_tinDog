     <!-- How to make the new Dog data render on the page, when click on the heart icon -->

**Breakdown:**

1.  getNewDog() => gives new dog object.
2.  getDogHtml() => will create an html for the dog object, and when called will render the html on the page.
3.  render() => will render the html from the _getDogHtml()_, function.

<!-- How, When, where to call the getNewDog() -->

=> Somehow attach the getNewDog() with the getDogHtml(), so when render() gets called, it will call the getNewDog(), which then call the getDogHtml() with the new object.
